# Library Software (vi-VN)
  Vietnamese Library software, built with SQLite,Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is a project I made for a try at the scientific and technical competition in Dak Lak Province, Viet Nam.

 # Starting the webserver
  To start the web server, open the python script `server.py` to run it up. Port 8008 is default, change if necessary.

# Change database informations
  To change database informations, open python scripts: `books.py`, `ids.py`, `borrows,py`.

# The rest is your control. This is open source, feel free to distribute, just remember to credit me.
